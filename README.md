## What's Happening Behind the Scenes
### Classes
Okay, so we use this thing called a JavaScript class called `Quiz`. It's like the boss that keeps everything organized. It knows the questions, keeps track of your score, and guides you through the quiz.

### Switch Statements
We've got these cool switch statements that help control what happens in the quiz. Depending on what's going on (like loading a question or giving feedback), the switch statements make sure everything runs smoothly.

### Try-Catch-Finally Statements
Ever heard of try-catch? It's like a safety net for errors. If something goes wrong, we catch it and let you know without ruining your quiz experience. Nice, right?

### Restarting for More Fun
Once you finish the quiz, we give you a "Restart Quiz" button. Clicking it shuffles the questions, so you can try again and beat your own score. It's like having unlimited fun!
